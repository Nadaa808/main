## ‚ùå Critical Security Gaps Identified & Fixed

### 1. **Rate Limiting Vulnerabilities**

**Issue:** Basic rate limiting (100 requests/15min) insufficient for authentication endpoints
**Risk Level:** **HIGH**
**Attack Vector:** Brute force attacks on 2FA tokens

**‚úÖ SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:**
```javascript
// Enhanced rate limiting for auth endpoints
const authRateLimit = rateLimit({
    windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
    max: 5, // Only 5 attempts per IP+email combination
    skipSuccessfulRequests: true
});

// Extremely strict 2FA rate limiting  
const twoFactorRateLimit = rateLimit({
    windowMs: 5 * 60 * 1000, // 5 minutes
    max: 3, // Only 3 2FA attempts per 5 minutes
});
```

### 2. **Account Lockout Missing**

**Issue:** No account lockout mechanism after failed attempts
**Risk Level:** **HIGH** 
**Attack Vector:** Persistent brute force attacks

**‚úÖ SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:**
```javascript
// Progressive lockout system
// 3 attempts = 5 min lockout
// 5 attempts = 15 min lockout  
// 7 attempts = 30 min lockout
// 10+ attempts = 1 hour lockout
```

### 3. **No Progressive Delays**

**Issue:** Attackers could make rapid successive attempts
**Risk Level:** **MEDIUM**
**Attack Vector:** Automated rapid-fire attacks

**‚úÖ SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:**
```javascript
// Progressive delay: 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s, max 30s
const delay = Math.min(Math.pow(2, attempts.count - 1) * 1000, 30000);
```

### 4. **Insufficient Activity Monitoring**

**Issue:** Limited detection of suspicious patterns
**Risk Level:** **MEDIUM**
**Attack Vector:** Sophisticated distributed attacks

**‚úÖ SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:**
```javascript
// Suspicious activity detection:
// - Multiple accounts from same IP
// - Automated tool detection  
// - Rapid succession attempts
// - All logged to ActivityLog
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Enhanced Security Implementation

### 1. **Multi-Layer Defense System**

**Layer 1: IP-based Rate Limiting**
- 5 auth attempts per 15 minutes per IP+email
- 3 2FA attempts per 5 minutes per IP+email

**Layer 2: Account Lockout**
- Progressive lockout duration based on attempt count
- Automatic unlock after timeout period
- All lockouts logged for audit

**Layer 3: Progressive Delays** 
- Exponential backoff for repeated failures
- Max 30-second delay to prevent DoS

**Layer 4: Suspicious Activity Detection**
- Pattern recognition for attack signatures
- Real-time alerting via activity logs
- IP reputation tracking

### 2. **Comprehensive Logging & Monitoring**

**All Security Events Logged:**
- Failed login attempts with IP and attempt count
- Account lockouts with duration and unlock time
- Suspicious activity patterns detected
- Successful logins with metadata
- 2FA usage patterns and backup code consumption

**Log Format:**
```javascript
{
    type: 'FAILED_2FA_ATTEMPT',
    description: 'Failed 2FA attempt #3 from IP 192.168.1.100',
    userId: 123,
    metadata: {
        ip: '192.168.1.100',
        attemptCount: 3,
        userAgent: 'Mozilla/5.0...'
    }
}
```
